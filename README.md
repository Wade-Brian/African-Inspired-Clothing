1. Theme & inspiration , I chose an African -inspired clothing theme because the vibrant colors and bold patterns represent cultural pride and identity.
2. the color palette uses earthy tones(orange,brown, gold and black) which are commonly associated with african textiles and beadwork.
3. Layout & structure , Used Bootstrap's grid system for a responsive structure that adjusts seamlessly between desktop, tablet and mobile.
4. The landing page has three main sections, Header with navigation menu, Hero section  with a large background image and tagline,Product section with four product cards and lastly Footer with branding and credits.
5. Hero section, A full-width background image showcasing African fabric patterns to immediately draw attention,Large bold headline with a smaller tagline to highlight the brand identity.
6. Product cards, Each card contains an image, product name, description and "Shop now" button, Added subtle hover effects(card scaling and button color change) for interactivity, Images represent African-inspired clothing and accessories(dress, shirt,headwrap and jewelry)
7. Responsiveness, Bootstrap's grid ensures the products display one per row on desktop and one per row on mobile, Added custom media queries for text resizing in the hero section to ensure readability on smaller screens.
8. Footer, A simple dark footer with white text for  contrast.
9. Why Bootstraps, Bootstrap provide prebuilt classes for responsiveness, spacing and grids, making it easier to ensure the page looks good on different screen sizes.It reduces the amount of custom css needed while still allowing personalization.
